One of the "Very Hard" puzzles is a Nintendo sponsored puzzle, which grabbed my attention.<br><br>Here is the problem as presented:<br><br><div style="margin-left:4em;"><b>The Goal</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;">Big News!<br>The SETI program has received a series of messages from Alpha Centauri. The most frequent message seems to be: <tt>541a4231 5d324646 27219a26 12497b0e 724eddcb 0e131617 9521bedf 55544dc7</tt><br>It is not known why these messages are encoded, but there is a good chance that the Alpha Centaurians are trying to evaluate our cognitive abilities before establishing advanced contact.<br>Our best engineers are working to decode these messages, and they've already succeeded at identifying the program that the Centaurians use to encode the messages. This program takes a size and a list of numbers as inputs. It then outputs the encoded message (see the pseudo-code below).<br>But so far, no one has been able to decode the messages. We are well aware that this task is by far the hardest that we've encountered, and that only a true NERD will be able to pull it off!<br><br></div><b>Rules</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;">Here is a pseudo-code version of the encoding program:<br><div style="margin-left:4em;"><tt><pre>READ size
READ size / 16 integers in array a
WRITE size / 16 zeros in array b

For i from 0 to size - 1:
  For j from 0 to size - 1:
    b[(i+j)/32] ^= ((a[i/32] >> (i%32)) & (a[j/32 + size/32] >> (j%32)) & 1) << ((i+j)%32)

PRINT b
</pre></tt></div>You can download a C++ version of the program <a href="https://www.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=1915207099028">here</a>.<br><br>The goal is to determine the series of numbers entered (array a) from the encoded output of the program (array b). The numbers - input and output - should be displayed in hexadecimal, 8 characters padded with 0 (for example, 42 would be displayed as 0000002a).<br>If you pass the output of your program as input to the encoder above, you should obtain the input provided to your program.<br><br>If there are several possible decoded values, you should display all the possibilities in alphabetical order.<br><br></div><b>Game Input</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;"><b>Input</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;">Line 1: size S<br>Line 2: N1 integers in hexadecimal format, separated by blank spaces<br></div><br><b>Output</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;">N2 integers in hexadecimal format, representing the decoded message.<br></div><br><b>Constraints</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;"><tt><pre>0 < S <= 256
0 < N1 <= 16
0 < N2 <= 32
</pre></tt></div><br><b>Example</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;"><b>Input</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;"><tt><pre>32

ebf2831f b0c152f9
</pre></tt></div></div></div></div>There are two parts to solving any puzzle:<ul><li>Figuring out what the problem actually is</li><li>Solving the problem, under the given constraints.</li></ul>The former will not be discussed here. I may save that for a later day. For the later, I will not be sharing source code to the solution directly as <a href="https://twitter.com/CodinGame/status/739387011149246464">"Copy pasting solutions is not fun"</a>. (However, if you have also solved the problem and can demonstrate that on the site, I'd be more than happy to exchange solutions.) Instead, I have modified the code to write out, step by step, what is happening. i.e. <i>This post is generated by the solution code while solving the problem.</i><br><br>So if you'd like to see very concrete solutions to test cases, read on! (if you want to solve this for yourself, stop now.)<br><br>- <a href="http://twitter.com/mike_acton">@mike_acton</a><br><br><b>CASE 1</b><br><div style="margin-left:4em;"><tt><pre>32
